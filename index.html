<h2>Project Proposal Description</h2>
<p>My partner and I would like to design and develop a game using JavaScript as well as HTML. 
More specifically we would like to build a maze. </p>
<h2>Desired Features That Can Be Delivered In The Given Time</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>a medium-size maze that is not too hard nor too easy for the player</li>
</ul>
<h2>Desired Features That Would Be Delivered If There Was More Time</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>a timer that restricts how much time the player has to complete the maze</li>
<li>a larger and more complex maze that takes more time and skill to complete</li>
</ul>
<h2>Languages and Platforms That Will Be Used</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Features Being Implemented That Demonstrate Things We Have Learned</h2>
<p>We will be using HTML for a good portion of this project, which we have become 
very familiar with thanks to the Getting To Know Each Other assignment as well as 
this proposal. For the project, we will have to do a lot of work with variables, which
is another topic we have briefly touched upon in class. 
</p>
<h2>Technical Features Being Implemented That Go Beyond What We Have Learned</h2>
<p>For this project, we will need to do some work with JavaScript, which is a language we have mentioned, 
but not one we have into great detail about in this class. Learning how to create a maze within HTML will
be a challenge in and of itself, so we will have to put a lot of work into figuring that out. We will also 
have to learn how to make our game piece move around the maze using HTML, so we will have to familiarize 
ourselves with many new concepts and functions within HTML need to do so.
